# Expo Go Module Loading Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when developing React Native apps with Expo and the Expo Go client.  The problem involves an "Invariant Violation" error caused by missing or incompatible native modules.  This often occurs when trying to utilize third-party libraries that rely on native code that Expo Go cannot handle directly. 

The example illustrates the error and provides a solution using a compatible alternative or adjusting the project setup.
