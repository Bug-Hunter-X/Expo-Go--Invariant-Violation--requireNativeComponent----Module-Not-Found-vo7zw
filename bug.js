This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test your application.  The error message usually indicates that a specific module or dependency is not found or cannot be loaded.  This often happens when the native modules required by the package are not correctly linked or are incompatible with the Expo Go environment.  Sometimes you will see a generic error message such as "Invariant Violation: requireNativeComponent: "RCTView" was not found."
