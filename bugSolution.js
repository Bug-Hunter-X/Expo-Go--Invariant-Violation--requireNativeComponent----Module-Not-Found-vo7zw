To resolve this issue, the best approach is to avoid packages with heavy reliance on native modules when developing with Expo Go. Here are some strategies:

1. **Use Expo-compatible alternatives:**  Check if there's an Expo-compatible version or a similar package that doesn't require native modules. For example, instead of using a package directly implementing native views, explore if you can achieve the same functionality using the built-in Expo components. 

2. **Eject from Expo (Advanced):**  If the package is absolutely essential and you cannot find a substitute, the last resort is to eject from Expo managed workflow to a bare React Native project. This allows you to manage native dependencies directly, but you will lose the benefits of the Expo managed workflow.

**Example (Illustrative):**

```javascript
// bug.js (Illustrative example - may not compile without context)
import React from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native'; // Problematic if using a package requiring native views
import SomeNativeModulePackage from 'some-native-module-package';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      <SomeNativeModulePackage />
    </View>
  );
}
```

```javascript
// bugSolution.js (Illustrative example - replace with actual solution)
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Using Expo-compatible components instead of native modules</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```
